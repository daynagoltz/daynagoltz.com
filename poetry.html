									<h3 id="Is it spotless?" class="major">Is it spotless?</h3>
									<h4>August 25th, 2024<br>
										Another poem inspired by one of my favorite movies, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. This poem is kind of a spoiler alert though, so if you haven't seen the movie yet, keep scrolling!!</h4>

									<p> Come watch my mind’s old movies.<br>
										Each scene is clear as day.<br>
										Is the film reel heavy with hoping?<br>
										Is the projector dusty and dazed?</p>

									<p>	Could you please hit re-record.<br>
										Replace and wipe it clean.<br>
										Each memory sticks on my skin<br>
										& leaves a sickly sheen.</p>

									<p>	My hair changes with the seasons,<br>
										It was short to match my temper.<br>
										Montage of collarbone length;<br>
										Reverse mortgage to unremember.</p>

									<p>	Would you delete me if you could?<br>
										Do you recall the time I stole?<br>
										Are we bound to meet again,<br>
										Like Clementine and Joel?</p>

									<!-- <h3 id="Delray" class="major">Delray</h3>
									<h4>April 24th, 2024</h4>
									<p> Where am I from?
										Beaches turned to boardwalks. Bricks in my gut.<br>
										Staring at my parents behind 8-month-old eyelashes, from a high chair at their favorite Italian restaurant.<br>
										We parked right outside.<br>
										Where am I from?<br>
										Not the metered spots that are never open, nor the 16th hotel, not the city you see in your magazine article. Not “The Best Winter Vacation Destination of 2024.”<br>
										This is not a destination, it’s my beginning.<br>
										Not a city, a town.<br>
										Not a place you bring the kids that they’ll vaguely remember in 10 years, the thought of gray clouds pummeling out their beach days.<br>
										One side of the sky a pastel horizon that I strum guitar under, the other side an unsettling darkness growing closer.<br>
										They don’t know that the clouds don’t listen to anybody.<br>
										Not even to me.<br>
										I was born in the rain — I carry its salt and stratospheric particles, made of witch hazel to soothe my cheeks, and the humidity of all my Florida summers.<br>
										The droplets find their home in the crease between my nose and my lips.<br>
										When they get too heavy, they reach my mouth.<br>
										I am made of them. They taste like me.</p> -->

									<h3 id="cosmic radiation" class="major">cosmic radiation</h3>
									<h4>January 4th, 2024<br>
										We were learning about the dose of radiation your body gets from each type of radiologic imaging and the professor said we get a "background dose" of radiation from the universe daily. Hence, this poem was born.</h4>
									<p> Humans—you and I—receive<br>
										“cosmic radiation from outer space” every day.<br>
										We absorb, denature and then renature it.<br>
										We become it, and it becomes us.<br>
										So I am a daughter of the cosmos like I’ve suspected<br>
										all this time,<br>
										or a sister of the cosmos,<br>
										or maybe a first cousin once removed?<br>
										Mercury’s blood saturates me, nonetheless,<br>
										and her exosphere is made of the same air I breathe.<br>
										Andromeda’s DNA cushions the tender muscles<br>
										between my shoulder blades.<br>
										Galactic in its dose,<br>
										alien in its abstraction,<br>
										earthly in its understanding.<br>
										Subastral, simple,<br>
										ordinary in the way this fact was taught to me:<br>
										the words dropped from my professor’s mouth<br>
										as if she hadn’t just expressed totality,<br>
										as if she hadn’t just told me that I’m made of stars.<br>
										Dosed about 3 millisieverts per year.<br>
										Alive in my body, spiraling and seeping,<br>
										merging with my mandible,<br>
										incorporating with my eyelashes,<br>
										welcomed by its victim—<br>
										its gracious host.<br>
										Who am I to fear the background dose<br>
										that makes me a part of this all;<br>
										that continues to further integrate my thighs<br>
										with the impossible system from which our galaxy<br>
										only scratches the surface?<br>
										Who am I to turn away the energy<br>
										that makes me more celestial each night,<br>
										nebulas claiming another square centimeter of my body,<br>
										bathing me in the glow of it all?<br>
										The universe is selfless<br>
										like a mother.<br>
										The constellations above are often concealed by city lights,<br>
										but those within us are eternal.<br>
										They speckle the soles of my feet,<br>
										soften my palate,<br>
										solder together my spine.<br>
										Who am I to bite the hand that made me?</p>


									<!-- <h3 id="thank you" class="major">thank you</h3>
									<h4>October 20th, 2023</h4>
									<p> And so I will love.<br>
										I will love the sound of strings that need to be replaced.<br>
										And I will love the work that keeps me up past my bedtime.<br>
										I will love the young man who stirs my matcha latte<br>
										And my seat warmer when it drops a degree below 70.<br>
										I will love the graphs that I follow with tired eyes.<br>
										And the 30 minute drive to the beach.<br>
										I will love the mother and daughter across from me<br>
										While I wait for my phone to be fixed.<br>
										I will love it when I hear them talking to the man across from them.<br>
										I will love their shared tongue,<br>
										Their common ground,<br>
										Their faces when I say “salamat.”<br>
										The way I can see their teeth when they smile.<br>
										The way they wonder how I know.<br>
										The way I feel like I’ve known them for years.<br>
										I will love the way it makes my eyes blur.<br>
										I will try to remember that I know it all because of love.<br>
										I will love so that I cannot hate.<br>
										Even when I feel like there is none left.<br>
										Even when I want to take my last breath.<br>
										I will love.<br></p> --> 

									<!-- <h3 id="Everything" class="major">Everything</h3>
									<h4>July 10th, 2023<br>
										Watched the movie "Everything Everywhere All at Once" for the first time, which inspired this one.</h4>
									<p> In another universe<br>
										A hop, skip, and a jump away<br>
										Are we together<br>
										In the mountains, by the sea<br>
										Sand around sure-footed<br>
										knee to knee.<br>
										Used Carolina as a ship<br>
										To sail across the world<br>
										Multilingual, collapsed timeline<br>
										Pasts unopened, turned over,<br>
										Darkened, left out to dry.<br>
										Did we find each other in that universe too?<br>
										Did we learn to surf,<br>
										Curled waves from Hawaii<br>
										Wax from your hands<br>
										Glued fingers to me.<br>
										Somersault through the parallel<br>
										Dance with me into another.<br>
										Free people found<br>
										Don’t you remember?<br>
										Eachother exposed<br>
										Raw choices together.<br>
										In one life you wrote films<br>
										And I manned the score.<br>
										The set somewhere wild<br>
										Ivy more poison<br>
										Monstera scenes<br>
										Director’s cut lore.<br>
										I found you in this one<br>
										And in the next I will too.<br>
										Mailed multiverse tomorrow<br>
										Return to sender star gazed<br>
										Hand addressed to you.</p> -->

									<h4>June 16th, 2023</h4>
									<p>I don’t care who you were.<br>
										Who are you today?<br>
										How did it reshape you<br>
										Old versions undrape you<br>
										Heel-dug Ego forced to give way?</p>

										<p>Past evils among us<br>
										Are they here in the room?<br>
										Just like your past lives<br>
										You allow what survives<br>
										Old bodies asleep in their tomb.</p>

										<p>I’d forgive all of yours<br>
										Up from flowered grave<br>
										While my old iterations<br>
										With their nasty temptations<br>
										Beg me to be saved.</p>

										<p>My standard stays doubled<br>
										To unyielding degree.<br>
										Despite mutual destruction<br>
										I deny my own damn fluxion.<br>
										You’re acquitted, but go easy on me.</p>


									<!-- <h3 id="Closure (version 2)" class="major">Closure (version 2)</h3>
									<h4>June 13th, 2023<br>
									wrote a first version of this but decided to take on the challenge of rhyming closure so I made a 2nd version</h4>
									<p> I looked for it everywhere<br>
										And I’m still scavenging.<br>
										Listened to lectures by Alan Watts<br>
										Searched in the silence between his declarations<br>
										In my earphones then in my car<br>
										Pulled up the mats, spare tire empty<br>
										Turned the wheels to check underneath<br>
										Every cushion, every pocket<br>
										Of my kinetic enclosure.</p>

										<p>Sought it on my walks next<br>
										But it’s hard when I like to walk past dark.<br>
										I’ll take pictures of the water and soft ground<br>
										For photo evidence if I miss it at first.<br>
										But the ripples always sing gibberish<br>
										And the rocks stay silent<br>
										Mycelium mouths say I’m not looking in the right places.<br>
										These pictures tell me nothing.<br>
										Such indecent exposure.</p>

										<p>What are the right places<br>
										If not from us: the last place it was seen?<br>
										I stuck my head out the window<br>
										And caught a glimpse of it on the balcony<br>
										Nope, it was just a mirage.<br>
										This year, the heat is playing tricks.<br>
										If I don’t find it soon, I’ll lose all composure.<br>
										My methods of madness aren’t all kosher.<br>
										I’m looking within, but I still can’t find closure.</p> 


									<h3 id="fruit" class="major">fruit</h3>
									<h4>June 10th, 2023</h4>
									<p> Can’t look it in the face<br>
										So I'll look at it by the fruit.<br>
										A blueberry beginning<br>
										Summer heat-ripened<br>
										Unexpectedly sweet<br>
										Abundance from thin air<br>
										By the handful.<br>
										It deepened over persimmons.<br>
										My first bite of earthly delight,<br>
										I’ve never been so sure<br>
										I loved a fruit more.<br>
										Lychee showed me a calmer way<br>
										Peeling each tiny gift<br>
										Resting so ready in lush tree leaves<br>
										That only bloom every two years<br>
										Tender taste always ends.<br>
										It turned sour with fall,<br>
										Overripe tears the flavor of figs,<br>
										Cut open in stained-glass light,<br>
										Nature’s details going unnoticed<br>
										Eating two for breakfast,<br>
										Rolled between my fingers<br>
										Digesting a palpable despair<br>
										Disguised as uncertainty.<br>
										On some afternoons I drink lemon water<br>
										It’s tart juice bites like calamansi,<br>
										Deep down I wish that it was<br>
										But I don’t think it ever will be.</p> -->


									<h3 id="alien again" class="major">alien again</h3>
									<h4>June 6th, 2023<br>
										Sometimes I forget how lucky we are to be on this Earth for a brief moment with the opportunity to love. This poem is my protest against becoming jaded with life.</h4>
									<p> I looked forward to Tuesdays<br>
										And you probably did, too.<br>
										The garbage man waves<br>
										As he soaked up my praise<br>
										Each Tuesday the world anew.</p>

										<p>To have a young mind<br>
										No hint of foreshadow<br>
										Oh, to be comfort-blind<br>
										See alien humankind<br>
										And make sense as you go.</p>

										<p>Or I guess, how we went<br>
										Before familiar ongoing<br>
										Hundreds from a cent,<br>
										For wasting, I repent<br>
										The time I spent unknowing.</p>

										<p>I just got back from buying food<br>
										Market more super each time.<br>
										My foreign feet surely intrude<br>
										With awe each aisle was imbued<br>
										Same body, but no paradigm.</p>

										<p>I’ll wake up tomorrow without plan<br>
										Reclaiming my childhood eyes.<br>
										Savor the wave from the garbage man<br>
										Stripped of the jade from old lifespan<br>
										And simply be under blue skies.</p>


									<h3 id="rose incense" class="major">rose incense</h3>
									<h4>May 23rd, 2023<br>
										Started this poem on May 8th but the rest of it came to me a couple weeks later. Slow burn like incense! </h4>
									<p> One time I burned rose incense<br>
										In the midst of chaotic hope<br>
										That the smoke would find its way to my heart.<br>
										Today I burn some incense<br>
										Not rose—I know better.<br>
										Hope’s been replaced<br>
										By something I can’t name.<br>
										Nameless smells good,<br>
										But I’d still prefer blameless.<br>
										I fall asleep on my back<br>
										Perfumed listless and aimless.</p>

										<p>I bought my mom some incense<br>
										Not rose—I know better.<br>
										She told me once she forgot to blow out the flame<br>
										And it burned down to its base.<br>
										Without scent<br>
										Without patience.<br>
										It’s silly, the mistakes that teach us peace.</p>

										<p>My mind can lead the smoke now<br>
										And in it I look for signs.<br>
										If I focus hard enough<br>
										I can keep the smoke in line.<br>
										Control’s an airy concept<br>
										Elusive and divine.<br>
										Tonight I’ll burn rose incense.<br>
										Heart surgery supine.</p>


									<!-- <h3 id="To Water" class="major">To Water</h3>
									<h4>May 16th, 2023</h4>
									<p> Please I’m begging.<br>
										Just a single sip.<br>
										I remember when you swam<br>
										In river’s fertile flow.<br>
										Straight from untouched mountains<br>
										Pure, ice cold<br>
										Delicious in its simplicity<br>
										Water grazed your long brown hair<br>
										Sunk deep into your skin<br>
										Gulping like you needed it<br>
										And it felt like you did.<br>
										The water is still here<br>
										But it doesn’t look as clear,<br>
										What do you think?<br>
										That’s when I learned you can lead a man to water,<br>
										But you can’t make him drink.</p>

										<p>So I dropped my grip on leather harness<br>
										Knuckles red<br>
										Palms white.<br>
										Flexed my tired fingers<br>
										Took a sip of said water<br>
										Hands cupped with what was left.<br>
										Breathed in a forgotten blue<br>
										Wet with release.<br>
										Said goodbye for the very last time,<br>
										On my path back from an old oasis<br>
										And I filled a bottle for the road.<br>
										Took a sip to quench my own<br>
										While I finally let your thirst be.<br>
										It tastes like letting go.<br>
										It finally tastes like me.</p> -->

										And when I scream “I hear you” to the Pacific highway map,<br>
										It whispers back “I know”<br>
										But continues its siren cry anyway.</p>

										<p>When my favorite band sets up shop in San Francisco<br>
										And my eyes drip sweet Grecian sea,<br>
										And I can’t tell whether Atlantic time is hours ahead or too far behind<br>
										I wonder if anything is timeless.</p>

										<p>Maybe just not for me.</p> -->


									<h3 id="Cliché" class="major">Cliché</h3>
									<h4>March 29th, 2023<br>
										My friend sent me a photo of her new car today laughing about how she bought a convertible on a snow day, and it got me thinking about irony and foresight and this poem was born
									</h4>
									<p> I know why convertible sales go up in the summer<br>
										And why Lexapro scripts do not.<br>
										I know why I forget nudging zinc on my nose<br>
										Just to be reminded by a later sunspot.</p>

										<p>I know why last weekend felt like a second<br>
										And why two years was its own fable.<br>
										The ending cliché, just like this metaphor,<br>
										Did I look forward or was I unable?</p>

										<p>I know why I never saw this coming,<br>
										Ego hiding plain future from fair thought.<br>
										The bad doesn’t last, and the good never stays<br>
										But they both leave around what they brought.</p>

										<p>Snow in my car, I left the roof open.<br>
										And not even aloe will soothe my burn.<br>
										I still don’t believe them when they say it gets better<br>
										But maybe I’ll just never learn.</p>

									<h3 id="interlude" class="major">interlude</h3>
									<h4>March 23rd, 2023</h4>
									<p> I wish I could play the piano<br>
										Lento to teach me the pace of solitude.<br>
										To find the gray nuance you stole<br>
										On a string of<br>
										Black and white keys<br>
										black and blue fists.</p>

										<p>I wish I could play the fiddle<br>
										Because nothing makes me shatter<br>
										Like folk sweet as summer peaches<br>
										Biting right into tender skin<br>
										Endless fruit, the pit somewhere far away.<br>
										We knew the band.</p>

										<p>I wish I could play the bass,<br>
										Stand-up legs on buckling knees<br>
										Because bassists know a secret that we don’t.</p>

										<p>Need to learn more instruments<br>
										Because acoustic tangles my hair.</p>

										<p>My own lonely symphony,<br>
										The reverb is grim to me,<br>
										A slowly moving prayer.</p>

									<h3 id="The little one" class="major">The little one</h3>
									<h4>march 27th, 2023</h4>
									<p> She takes her chalk<br>
										And her pink corduroy pants<br>
										Down to the dock.<br>
										Legs dangle above,<br>
										Barnacles below,<br>
										And the wood gifts crevices<br>
										Made for skin to fill.<br>
										She fits in perfectly.<br>
										And she will use the daylight,<br>
										Its transience a problem for tonight,<br>
										To hum and watch the wind play with the water,<br>
										And draw people that look like trees,<br>
										And wonder if the crab she sees today<br>
										Is the same crab she saw yesterday,<br>
										Or if this is just the other crab’s wife.<br>
										Sometimes I forget my age by accident<br>
										And sometimes I forget it on purpose.<br>
										Either way, I get to be with the little one<br>
										and tell her that it is the same crab as yesterday<br>
										and the day before.<br>
										And so are we.</p>

									<h3 id="Love, the sweater thief" class="major">Love, the sweater thief</h3>
									<h4>march 21st, 2023<br>
										Poems with concise rhyme schemes have been really healing for me lately. </h4>
									<p> Fear in the fabric<br>
										Loss in the loom<br>
										Woven so tragic<br>
										Garments consume.</p>

									<p>	Blue jacket so gentle<br>
										Folded through haze<br>
										To wear makes me mental<br>
										To keep still delays</p>

									<p>	Healing so slow<br>
										Stitching sincere<br>
										Rosy cheeks just for show<br>
										The cloth getting sheer</p>

									<p>	Wearing what hurts.<br>
										My closet knows grief<br>
										Bet you’re buying new shirts.<br>
										Love, the sweater thief.</p>

									<h4>march 16th, 2023</h4>
				
									<p>Music in the shower<br>
										Music every hour<br>
										Can’t stand the echo you left behind in all your silent power.</p>

										<p>Music as I understand the brain<br>
										Music that sounds better in the rain<br>
										I still tear up on the last refrain.</p>

										<p>Music soaked up with newfound rage<br>
										Music that makes me feel my age<br>
										Screaming lungs contained in fragile rib cage.</p>

										<p>Music as I glide and shave<br>
										Music that knows just what I crave<br>
										I wish it wasn’t one of the songs that you gave.</p>

										<p>Music that has me by the throat<br>
										Music I’ve learned simply by rote.<br>
										Music that kills me before the last note.</p> -->

									<h4>march 12th, 2023<br>
										This one was inspired by a conversation I had with friends on a tiny beach at sunset.<br>
										Dedicated to finding ourselves alongside lovely little humans who are doing the same thing.</h4>
									<p> I eat my orange alone<br>
										And sometimes I eat the rind<br>
										Because if I can make the bitter sweet,<br>
										Months of tears can be redefined.</p>

										<p>Each carpel peels off slowly<br>
										Teaching me to listen, to stop and hear.<br>
										Who knew citrus had so many lessons?<br>
										Only March and it’s been a long year.</p>

										<p>I can smell it on my fingertips<br>
										Infatuated with the taste.<br>
										Juice grazes each thought of my wandering mind<br>
										Unbothered, unsettled, unchaste.</p>

										<p>When will I ever learn?<br>
										Maybe once orange season ends too soon.<br>
										Just when I got used to golden fruit<br>
										On each lonely afternoon.</p>

									<h4>march 1st, 2023</h4>
										<p>
											If I had grown up with brothers<br>
										What would they have thought of me?<br>
										Nothing but an X<br>
										A soft gaze, light hands<br>
										In their world of mastery and charge.<br></p>

										<p>Would they have seen my skill?<br>
										Or noticed my nuanced understanding<br>
										My faceted wit<br>
										My linear mind or my desire for more?<br></p>

										<p>Would they have been threatened?<br>
										By the commitment,<br>
										The burning incessant route I take,<br>
										Gnawing my way up<br>
										Because I see what I can be.<br>
										My deep knowing that it’s on the same plane.<br>
										So close they can’t stand in my way.<br></p>

										<p>If I had grown up with brothers<br>
										Would my dad have loved them more?<br>
										Would my spirit have been muddled<br>
										By less fatherly love?<br>
										Not that there was much<br>
										But still enough.<br></p>

										<p>Would his teaching hands<br>
										Be replaced by teaching gloves<br>
										Catching their baseballs<br>
										70 miles per hour.<br>
										Like my heart.<br>
										No, my head.<br>
										Would I have had to beg to be seen?<br></p>

										<p>Not begging now,<br>
										But I’m moving at the speed of a light with too many corners to illuminate.<br>
										Too much momentum to stop and wonder<br>
										If I had grown up with brothers<br>
										Would they love me more than my sisters do?<br>
										Would I value their bond over my work?<br>
										Would I feel protected,<br>
										A desire that I loathe calling mine?<br>
										Would they have made me feel strong behind their armor<br>
										Or too weak to defend my home of skin and bones?<br></p>

										<p>So many what-if’s.<br>
										Femininity amplified by the thought of men;<br>
										God, I can’t escape it.<br>
										Masculinity complacent, just beneath the surface<br>
										When I need it now the most.<br>
										I think I would have liked brothers.<br></p> -->

									<h4>february 20th, 2023</h4>
										<p> 
										Every color I write in has a shade of despair,<br>
										Sadness I don’t even know exists until I make it into words.<br>
										Turquoise, azure, navy, or midnight blue all look the same.<br>
										The sentences themselves create new flavors of sorrow.<br></p>

										<p>My words lay down fresh paths for me to crawl along<br>
										Soil beneath my nails.<br>
										It feels so thick, dense with a <br>truth that follows me despite my attempts to leave it behind.<br></p>

										<p>My words are made of lines and curves. <br>
										So sterile and uniform<br>
										That what they imply could only be so<br>
										Raw, visceral, unkempt, stabbing.<br>
										My words love irony.<br></p>

										<p>And I love my words.<br>
										Addicted to the pain that they make me feel,<br>
										Help me feel.<br>
										The way they reopen tender pink scars,<br>
										micro-wounds I don’t notice<br>
										Until my entire body bleeds.<br></p>

										<p>And then I use those drops to finish my paragraph.<br>
										Blood to paper, skin to soil, eyes to salt.<br></p> -->

									<h4>february 12th, 2023</h4>
										<p>
											A city so warm but it leaves me so cold.<br>
										A city of forks and knives behold.<br>
										A disposable I developed three months too late,<br>
										Pictures dusting so neatly while I silently wait.</p>

										<p>How vain of me to think that your words were meant for me.<br>
										How vain of me to steal them, the first two lines a plea.<br>
										Desperation’s not the title, or at least not the one I claim.<br>
										Been through all five stages, I suppose I’ve made it to shame.</p>

										<p>Built a domain all to myself, twelve whole dollars a year.<br>
										It’s full of my heart’s fabric, corralled by my career.<br>
										Strawberries on my birthday, chlorine in our pores.<br>
										Twenty-three’s cedar so much sweeter than twenty-four’s.</p>

										<p>My eyes would look the same again, chocolate, knowing, clear.<br>
										Playlists laced with melodies that I can’t stand to hear.<br>
										Longer for-loops, same strumming pattern, at least I am creating.<br>
										I’ll drink bitter coffee and relish in my books, but just know that I’m waiting.</p>

										<p>I feel through these words when I cannot feel the rest.<br>
										The way that hell looks like my street leaves me so impressed.<br>
										I can’t believe I used to overlook dead trees, dead Dads, dead stars.<br>
										I could see them in the astral realm on my sleepy way to Mars.</p>

										<p>I remember floating through punctuated black, the violet light unrefined.<br>
										Dissolving my fears, lifting my soul, intuition so entwined.<br>
										I traced Orion’s belt with my eyelashes and cradled his buckle in my lips.<br>
										Until it wrapped around the slim of my neck, dragging me toward eclipse.</p>

										<p>Have they found life there yet, on its softly dusted red barren face?<br>
										I’m on my way so I’ll let you know but I think it might be wrong time, right space.<br>
										My arteries are dry from wandering in this universe of my own unraveled head.<br>
										If they’re any forewarning of what’s to come, I have a feeling Mars will be dead.</p>

										<p>Don’t shoot the messenger, I still want to live, if only for the hope of a sprout.<br>
										I see light in the distance, it could be the end, or it could be my only way out.</p> -->

									honorable mention in 2023 William Carlos Williams poetry competition sponsored by the Northeast Ohio Medical University</h4>
									
										<p>Scapula, because it was the first bone I learned.<br>
										Lunate, because it reminds me of the moon.<br>
										Sternum, because it’s close to my heart.</p>

										<p>No, I’m choosing to remember wrong.<br>
										Scapula, because that was what broke.<br>
										Along with two ribs.<br>
										Lunate, because your hand couldn’t soften your fall.<br>
										The hand of a surgeon.<br>
										Sternum, because it was close to your heart.</p>

										<p>Bones are all that’s left.<br>
										My vertebrae remember your hands<br>
										Checking for scoliosis<br>
										But the spines of your favorite books remain unbent.<br>
										Sandpaper stiff.</p>

										<p>And you never told me about your working days<br>
										But I heard the stories, still.<br>
										What happened?<br>
										Swallow.<br>
										Hard pill.<br>
										Coughing it up as I read my speech<br>
										Coffin at foot.</p>

										<p>Oh, these are my favorite bones.<br>
										They said twenty-two was too young<br>
										To say goodbye to a father<br>
										Even though I mourned my youth<br>
										The first time you forgot my age.<p>

										<p>At least I have my favorite bones…<br>
										Not your hands, your dementia, nor you.<br>
										But I know I’ll love them always,<br>
										Through crepitus and blue.</p>
