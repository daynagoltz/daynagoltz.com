									<h3 id="alien again" class="major">alien again</h3>
									<h4>June 6th, 2023<br>
										Sometimes I forget how lucky we are to be on this Earth for a brief moment with the opportunity to love. This poem is my protest against becoming jaded with life.</h4>
									<p> I looked forward to Tuesdays<br>
										And you probably did, too.<br>
										The garbage man waves<br>
										As he soaked up my praise<br>
										Each Tuesday the world anew.</p>

										<p>To have a young mind<br>
										No hint of foreshadow<br>
										Oh, to be comfort-blind<br>
										See alien humankind<br>
										And make sense as you go.</p>

										<p>Or I guess, how we went<br>
										Before familiar ongoing<br>
										Hundreds from a cent,<br>
										For wasting, I repent<br>
										The time I spent unknowing.</p>

										<p>I just got back from buying food<br>
										Market more super each time.<br>
										My foreign feet surely intrude<br>
										With awe each aisle was imbued<br>
										Same body, but no paradigm.</p>

										<p>I’ll wake up tomorrow without plan<br>
										Reclaiming my childhood eyes.<br>
										Savor the wave from the garbage man<br>
										Stripped of the jade from old lifespan<br>
										And simply be under blue skies.</p>


									<h3 id="rose incense" class="major">rose incense</h3>
									<h4>May 23rd, 2023<br>
										Started this poem on May 8th but the rest of it came to me a couple weeks later. Slow burn like incense. Slow burn like self-love.</h4>
									<p> One time I burned rose incense<br>
										In the midst of chaotic hope<br>
										That the smoke would find its way to my heart.<br>
										Today I burn some incense<br>
										Not rose—I know better.<br>
										Hope’s been replaced<br>
										By something I can’t name.<br>
										Nameless smells good,<br>
										But I’d still prefer blameless.<br>
										I fall asleep on my back<br>
										Perfumed listless and aimless.</p>

										<p>I bought my mom some incense<br>
										Not rose—I know better.<br>
										She told me once she forgot to blow out the flame<br>
										And it burned down to its base.<br>
										Without scent<br>
										Without patience.<br>
										It’s silly, the mistakes that teach us peace.</p>

										<p>My mind can lead the smoke now<br>
										And in it I look for signs.<br>
										If I focus hard enough<br>
										I can keep the smoke in line.<br>
										Control’s an airy concept<br>
										Elusive and divine.<br>
										Tonight I’ll burn rose incense.<br>
										Heart surgery supine.</p>


									<h3 id="To Water" class="major">To Water</h3>
									<h4>May 16th, 2023</h4>
									<p> Please I’m begging.<br>
										Just a single sip.<br>
										I remember when you swam<br>
										In river’s fertile flow.<br>
										Straight from untouched mountains<br>
										Pure, ice cold<br>
										Delicious in its simplicity<br>
										Water grazed your long brown hair<br>
										Sunk deep into your skin<br>
										Gulping like you needed it<br>
										And it felt like you did.<br>
										The water is still here<br>
										But it doesn’t look as clear,<br>
										What do you think?<br>
										That’s when I learned you can lead a man to water,<br>
										But you can’t make him drink.</p>

										<p>So I dropped my grip on leather harness<br>
										Knuckles red<br>
										Palms white.<br>
										Flexed my tired fingers<br>
										Took a sip of said water<br>
										Hands cupped with what was left.<br>
										Breathed in a forgotten blue<br>
										Wet with release.<br>
										Said goodbye for the very last time,<br>
										On my path back from an old oasis<br>
										And I filled a bottle for the road.<br>
										Took a sip to quench my own<br>
										While I finally let your thirst be.<br>
										It tastes like letting go.<br>
										It finally tastes like me.</p>


									<h3 id="gemini" class="major">gemini</h3>
									<h4>May 10th, 2023<br>
									My alter ego actually wrote this one so take it with a grain of salt. Sometimes writing as a different version of myself is so therapeutic, maybe because there's always a little truth to it.</h4>
									<p> Keen Aries is the god of war<br>
										So don’t you act surprised.<br>
										My april sun builds soft rapport<br>
										Before I act uncivilized.</p>

										<p>Being a traitor feels so damn good.<br>
										Remember all is fair.<br>
										Weapons made of aching wood,<br>
										Women scorned, music rare.</p>

										<p>I’m Gemini in my preying calm<br>
										Feather brown eyes of purity.<br>
										Got that June sign from hazel Mom<br>
										Playing with your worst insecurity.</p>

										<p>Speaking of hazel, I just discovered<br>
										The green before Florida dawn.<br>
										Aquarius observant gently uncovered<br>
										Night’s conclusion so foregone.</p>

										<p>The best part is my craving stays,<br>
										I loved it even more than I expected.<br>
										And I still would have despite your gaze<br>
										Your pain along with it erected.</p>

										<p>This springtime war is not about you<br>
										It’s about my revolving potential.<br>
										I will lie, because to myself I stay true.<br>
										My fire sign’s essential.</p>


									<h3 id="humble unknown" class="major">humble unknown</h3>
									<h4>May 3rd, 2023</h4>
									<p> Running after promises that I wish were mine to give.<br>
										But uncertainty leaves me utterly promise-less.</p>

										<p>I would have given you the ten year plan,<br>
										Placed the pencil in your palms.<br>
										Edit my movements, each line yours to transcribe,<br>
										translate in the serene way you describe.</p>

										<p>Take all my nonsense for just a little longer<br>
										Rewrite what's to come, lay down with me in this epilogue, <br>
										erasing so frantic but never fast enough.</p>

										<p>My oath currency—take my last coin.<br>
										From my pledge penniless plight,<br>
										I’d prefer you eat first, I’ll starve to be sure.<br>
										No money manuscript of what I endure.</p>

										<p>I miss my old friend, her name was control.<br>
										Lovers to enemies, she left at the last goodbye,<br>
										wrists unchained, feet untied.</p>

										<p>Please finish my paragraph.<br>
										I won’t ask for promises<br>
										Because I can’t give any in return.<br>
										I’m so tired of writing alone—<br>
										All I can give you is my humble unknown.</p>

									
									<h3 id="sumo season pt.2" class="major">sumo season pt.2</h3>
									<h4>Apriil 24th, 2023<br>
										I didn't know there would be a part 2 when I wrote part 1, but something felt right about this.</h4>
									<p> Well, I guess that’s it.<br>
										Trader Joe’s let me down.<br>
										No more sumos, soft and full.<br>
										This lonely time around.</p>

										<p>Just like people, habits change.<br>
										My orange ritual forced to shift.<br>
										I’ll try to be happy with minneolas<br>
										Joy unbearingly makeshift.</p>

										<p>I’ll still lock eyes with the sun while I peel.<br>
										Smaller fruit from a different tree.<br>
										Produce imitates its grand yellow shape<br>
										Just like my days always imitate me.</p>

										<p>I smile as I reach the very last piece.<br>
										Find the strength for goodbyes that I lack.<br>
										Until next year, my favorite season.<br>
										The snack that smiles back.</p>


									<h3 id="pentameter lost" class="major">pentameter lost</h3>
									<h4>April 23rd, 2023</h4>
									<p> I wish it was like railroad tracks, so straight.<br>
										Etched into Earth, blueprint instead of fate.<br>
										Like the algebra I took in sixth grade.<br>
										Linear dance, predictable in wade.</p>

										<p>Chronology works for those who know how<br>
										To love beyond thee, Shakespearean vow.<br>
										Careful my lover, tread still and be kind.<br>
										I still don’t break even, change left behind.</p>

										<p>Every time I think I know what comes next.<br>
										Two weeks of slow burn, unbalanced paychecks.<br>
										Maybe calendar years are not for me.<br>
										Punished with black hole hours, awry, beastly.</p>

										<p>Swirling in the undertow, dragged through hell and back<br>
										Flailing limbs catch old scents, smooth cologne and lilac.<br>
										Broke my own rules far too much to handle.<br>
										To your unswerving mind, I don’t raise a candle.</p>


									<h3 id="untitled" class="major">untitled</h3>
									<h4>April 16th, 2023<br>
										I wasn't sure what to call this one to represent how I feel, so untitled felt right.</h4>
									<p> Yesterday I folded my laundry<br>
										And put new flowers in the vase.<br>
										Today I’m not sure how I did that<br>
										Or who I ever was.</p>

										<p>It’s 1 step forward into the crosswalk<br>
										And then an eighteen-wheeler hit.<br>
										Sitting pretty in the trucks you used to hate.<br>
										Stranger facade on familiar pavement.</p>

										<p>My heart rolled onto the sidewalk<br>
										Loose veins in the shape of your name.<br>
										Cold-blooded fingers change the radio station.<br>
										It’s all part of your twisted game.</p>


									<h3 id="My Box" class="major">My Box</h3>
									<h4>April 12th, 2023</h4>
									<p> My box has almighty lightning<br>
										Never seen a storm so frightening<br>
										I don’t think the eye is near.</p>

										<p>Monsoon fills my nostrils with dread<br>
										Even the horse buries its head<br>
										But the box is still transparent this year.</p>

										<p>So you can probably see right through it<br>
										Closed eyes, criss-cross, candle-lit<br>
										To me meditating behind its veneer.</p>

										<p>Electric moisture destroying wallpaper.<br>
										What’s it like up there above the vapor?<br>
										Is the ladder top calm and clear?</p>

										<p>What’s the meaning in my hurricanes?<br>
										Of all the things my box contains,<br>
										I can’t believe the horse is still here.</p>


									<h3 id="Redemption" class="major">Redemption</h3>
									<h4>April 8th, 2023</h4>
									<p> God is a woman.<br> 
										Fingernails painted red<br> 
										Blood for life<br> 
										And blood for death.<br> 
										The touch of Creation.<br> 
										10 foot oak arms grand<br> 
										Sickly soft<br> 
										And sappy sweet.<br> 
										In a dream I made it to heaven.<br> 
										She wrapped them around me<br> 
										And with all her conviction,<br> 
										All of her full-bodied, descending, omni-loving<br> 
										Supernatural peace<br> 
										She sighed<br> 
										“I forgive you.”<br></p>

									<h3 id="the title is timeless" class="major">the title is timeless</h3>
									<h4>April 6th, 2023</h4>
									<p> My Florida friend showed me a Florida song<br>
										But Tennessee whiskey still soothes the back of my throat.</p>

										<p>I thought of sending it to ears that I know would relish in light vocals,<br>
										The ones that sound like soda pop<br>
										Sundresses swaying on Appalachian hilltops<br>
										But maybe I should start keeping some things to my little peninsula.<br>
										The first thing that’s belonged to me in a long time.</p>

										<p>I wish the west coast didn’t call so loudly.<br>
										And when I scream “I hear you” to the Pacific highway map,<br>
										It whispers back “I know”<br>
										But continues its siren cry anyway.</p>

										<p>When my favorite band sets up shop in San Francisco<br>
										And my eyes drip sweet Grecian sea,<br>
										And I can’t tell whether Atlantic time is hours ahead or too far behind<br>
										I wonder if anything is timeless.</p>

										<p>Maybe just not for me.</p>


									<h3 id="Cliché" class="major">Cliché</h3>
									<h4>March 29th, 2023<br>
										My friend sent me a photo of her new car today laughing about how she bought a convertible on a snow day, and it got me thinking about irony and foresight and feelings... and this poem was born
									</h4>
									<p> I know why convertible sales go up in the summer<br>
										And why Lexapro scripts do not.<br>
										I know why I forget nudging zinc on my nose<br>
										Just to be reminded by a later sunspot.</p>

										<p>I know why last weekend felt like a second<br>
										And why two years was its own fable.<br>
										The ending cliché, just like this metaphor,<br>
										Did I look forward or was I unable?</p>

										<p>I know why I never saw this coming,<br>
										Ego hiding plain future from fair thought.<br>
										The bad doesn’t last, and the good never stays<br>
										But they both leave around what they brought.</p>

										<p>Snow in my car, I left the roof open.<br>
										And not even aloe will soothe my burn.<br>
										I still don’t believe them when they say it gets better<br>
										But maybe I’ll just never learn.</p>

									<h3 id="interlude" class="major">interlude</h3>
									<h4>March 23rd, 2023</h4>
									<p> I wish I could play the piano<br>
										Lento to teach me the pace of solitude.<br>
										To find the gray nuance you stole<br>
										On a string of<br>
										Black and white keys<br>
										black and blue fists.</p>

										<p>I wish I could play the fiddle<br>
										Because nothing makes me shatter<br>
										Like folk sweet as summer peaches<br>
										Biting right into tender skin<br>
										Endless fruit, the pit somewhere far away.<br>
										We knew the band.</p>

										<p>I wish I could play the bass,<br>
										Stand-up legs on buckling knees<br>
										Because bassists know a secret that we don’t.</p>

										<p>Need to learn more instruments<br>
										Because acoustic tangles my hair.</p>

										<p>My own lonely symphony,<br>
										The reverb is grim to me,<br>
										A slowly moving prayer.</p>

									<h3 id="The little one" class="major">The little one</h3>
									<h4>march 27th, 2023</h4>
									<p> She takes her chalk<br>
										And her pink corduroy pants<br>
										Down to the dock.<br>
										Legs dangle above,<br>
										Barnacles below,<br>
										And the wood gifts crevices<br>
										Made for skin to fill.<br>
										She fits in perfectly.<br>
										And she will use the daylight,<br>
										Its transience a problem for tonight,<br>
										To hum and watch the wind play with the water,<br>
										And draw people that look like trees,<br>
										And wonder if the crab she sees today<br>
										Is the same crab she saw yesterday,<br>
										Or if this is just the other crab’s wife.<br>
										Sometimes I forget my age by accident<br>
										And sometimes I forget it on purpose.<br>
										Either way, I get to be with the little one<br>
										and tell her that it is the same crab as yesterday<br>
										and the day before.<br>
										And so are we.</p>

									<h3 id="Love, the sweater thief" class="major">Love, the sweater thief</h3>
									<h4>march 21st, 2023<br>
										Poems with concise rhyme schemes have been really healing for me lately. Maybe the loop
										of a rhyme provides a sort of closure and predictability that is comforting.</h4>
									<p> Fear in the fabric<br>
										Loss in the loom<br>
										Woven so tragic<br>
										Garments consume.</p>

									<p>	Blue jacket so gentle<br>
										Folded through haze<br>
										To wear makes me mental<br>
										To keep still delays</p>

									<p>	Healing so slow<br>
										Stitching sincere<br>
										Rosy cheeks just for show<br>
										The cloth getting sheer</p>

									<p>	Wearing what hurts.<br>
										My closet knows grief<br>
										Bet you’re buying new shirts.<br>
										Love, the sweater thief.</p>


									<h3 id="broadripple (music in the shower)" class="major">broadripple (music in the shower)</h3>
									<h4>march 16th, 2023</h4>
				
									<p>Music in the shower<br>
										Music every hour<br>
										Can’t stand the echo you left behind in all your silent power.</p>

										<p>Music as I understand the brain<br>
										Music that sounds better in the rain<br>
										I still tear up on the last refrain.</p>

										<p>Music soaked up with newfound rage<br>
										Music that makes me feel my age<br>
										Screaming lungs contained in fragile rib cage.</p>

										<p>Music as I glide and shave<br>
										Music that knows just what I crave<br>
										I wish it wasn’t one of the songs that you gave.</p>

										<p>Music that has me by the throat<br>
										Music I’ve learned simply by rote.<br>
										Music that kills me before the last note.</p>


									<h3 id="sumo season" class="major">sumo season</h3>
									<h4>march 12th, 2023<br>
										This one was inspired by a conversation I had with friends on a tiny beach at sunset.<br>
										Dedicated to finding ourselves alongside lovely little humans who are doing the same thing.</h4>
									<p> I eat my orange alone<br>
										And sometimes I eat the rind<br>
										Because if I can make the bitter sweet,<br>
										Months of tears can be redefined.</p>

										<p>Each carpel peels off slowly<br>
										Teaching me to listen, to stop and hear.<br>
										Who knew citrus had so many lessons?<br>
										Only March and it’s been a long year.</p>

										<p>I can smell it on my fingertips<br>
										Infatuated with the taste.<br>
										Juice grazes each thought of my wandering mind<br>
										Unbothered, unsettled, unchaste.</p>

										<p>When will I ever learn?<br>
										Maybe once orange season ends too soon.<br>
										Just when I got used to golden fruit<br>
										On each lonely afternoon.</p>

									
									<h3 id="If I had grown up with brothers" class="major">If I had grown up with brothers</h3>
									<h4>march 1st, 2023</h4>
										<p>
											If I had grown up with brothers<br>
										What would they have thought of me?<br>
										Nothing but an X<br>
										A soft gaze, light hands<br>
										In their world of mastery and charge.<br></p>

										<p>Would they have seen my skill?<br>
										Or noticed my nuanced understanding<br>
										My faceted wit<br>
										My linear mind or my desire for more?<br></p>

										<p>Would they have been threatened?<br>
										By the commitment,<br>
										The burning incessant route I take,<br>
										Gnawing my way up<br>
										Because I see what I can be.<br>
										My deep knowing that it’s on the same plane.<br>
										So close they can’t stand in my way.<br></p>

										<p>If I had grown up with brothers<br>
										Would my dad have loved them more?<br>
										Would my spirit have been muddled<br>
										By less fatherly love?<br>
										Not that there was much<br>
										But still enough.<br></p>

										<p>Would his teaching hands<br>
										Be replaced by teaching gloves<br>
										Catching their baseballs<br>
										70 miles per hour.<br>
										Like my heart.<br>
										No, my head.<br>
										Would I have had to beg to be seen?<br></p>

										<p>Not begging now,<br>
										But I’m moving at the speed of a light with too many corners to illuminate.<br>
										Too much momentum to stop and wonder<br>
										If I had grown up with brothers<br>
										Would they love me more than my sisters do?<br>
										Would I value their bond over my work?<br>
										Would I feel protected,<br>
										A desire that I loathe calling mine?<br>
										Would they have made me feel strong behind their armor<br>
										Or too weak to defend my home of skin and bones?<br></p>

										<p>So many what-if’s.<br>
										Femininity amplified by the thought of men;<br>
										God, I can’t escape it.<br>
										Masculinity complacent, just beneath the surface<br>
										When I need it now the most.<br>
										I think I would have liked brothers.<br></p>

									
									<h3 id="eyes to salt." class="major">eyes to salt.</h3>
									<h4>february 20th, 2023</h4>
										<p> 
										Every color I write in has a shade of despair,<br>
										Sadness I don’t even know exists until I make it into words.<br>
										Turquoise, azure, navy, or midnight blue all look the same.<br>
										The sentences themselves create new flavors of sorrow.<br></p>

										<p>My words lay down fresh paths for me to crawl along<br>
										Soil beneath my nails.<br>
										It feels so thick, dense with a <br>truth that follows me despite my attempts to leave it behind.<br></p>

										<p>My words are made of lines and curves. <br>
										So sterile and uniform<br>
										That what they imply could only be so<br>
										Raw, visceral, unkempt, stabbing.<br>
										My words love irony.<br></p>

										<p>And I love my words.<br>
										Addicted to the pain that they make me feel,<br>
										Help me feel.<br>
										The way they reopen tender pink scars,<br>
										micro-wounds I don’t notice<br>
										Until my entire body bleeds.<br></p>

										<p>And then I use those drops to finish my paragraph.<br>
										Blood to paper, skin to soil, eyes to salt.<br></p>


									<h3 id="Waiting" class="major">Waiting</h3>
									<h4>february 12th, 2023</h4>
										<p>
											A city so warm but it leaves me so cold.<br>
										A city of forks and knives behold.<br>
										A disposable I developed three months too late,<br>
										Pictures dusting so neatly while I silently wait.</p>

										<p>How vain of me to think that your words were meant for me.<br>
										How vain of me to steal them, the first two lines a plea.<br>
										Desperation’s not the title, or at least not the one I claim.<br>
										Been through all five stages, I suppose I’ve made it to shame.</p>

										<p>Built a domain all to myself, twelve whole dollars a year.<br>
										It’s full of my heart’s fabric, corralled by my career.<br>
										Strawberries on my birthday, chlorine in our pores.<br>
										Twenty-three’s cedar so much sweeter than twenty-four’s.</p>

										<p>My eyes would look the same again, chocolate, knowing, clear.<br>
										Playlists laced with melodies that I can’t stand to hear.<br>
										Longer for-loops, same strumming pattern, at least I am creating.<br>
										I’ll drink bitter coffee and relish in my books, but just know that I’m waiting.</p>


									<h3 id="Mars is dead." class="major">Mars is dead.</h3>
									<h4>february 10th, 2023</h4>
										<p>I feel through these words when I cannot feel the rest.<br>
										The way that hell looks like my street leaves me so impressed.<br>
										I can’t believe I used to overlook dead trees, dead Dads, dead stars.<br>
										I could see them in the astral realm on my sleepy way to Mars.</p>

										<p>I remember floating through punctuated black, the violet light unrefined.<br>
										Dissolving my fears, lifting my soul, intuition so entwined.<br>
										I traced Orion’s belt with my eyelashes and cradled his buckle in my lips.<br>
										Until it wrapped around the slim of my neck, dragging me toward eclipse.</p>

										<p>Have they found life there yet, on its softly dusted red barren face?<br>
										I’m on my way so I’ll let you know but I think it might be wrong time, right space.<br>
										My arteries are dry from wandering in this universe of my own unraveled head.<br>
										If they’re any forewarning of what’s to come, I have a feeling Mars will be dead.</p>

										<p>Don’t shoot the messenger, I still want to live, if only for the hope of a sprout.<br>
										I see light in the distance, it could be the end, or it could be my only way out.</p>

									<h4>december 2nd, 2022<br>
									honorable mention in 2023 William Carlos Williams poetry competition sponsored by the Northeast Ohio Medical University</h4>
									
										<p>Scapula, because it was the first bone I learned.<br>
										Lunate, because it reminds me of the moon.<br>
										Sternum, because it’s close to my heart.</p>

										<p>No, I’m choosing to remember wrong.<br>
										Scapula, because that was what broke.<br>
										Along with two ribs.<br>
										Lunate, because your hand couldn’t soften your fall.<br>
										The hand of a surgeon.<br>
										Sternum, because it was close to your heart.</p>

										<p>Bones are all that’s left.<br>
										My vertebrae remember your hands<br>
										Checking for scoliosis<br>
										But the spines of your favorite books remain unbent.<br>
										Sandpaper stiff.</p>

										<p>And you never told me about your working days<br>
										But I heard the stories, still.<br>
										What happened?<br>
										Swallow.<br>
										Hard pill.<br>
										Coughing it up as I read my speech<br>
										Coffin at foot.</p>

										<p>Oh, these are my favorite bones.<br>
										They said twenty-two was too young<br>
										To say goodbye to a father<br>
										Even though I mourned my youth<br>
										The first time you forgot my age.<p>

										<p>At least I have my favorite bones…<br>
										Not your hands, your dementia, nor you.<br>
										But I know I’ll love them always,<br>
										Through crepitus and blue.</p>
